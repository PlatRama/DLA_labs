# DLA_Labs
In this repo, you’ll find all the code I wrote and the results I collected for the DLA labs.  

## Lab1 - CNNs
In this lab I will try to duplicate (on a small scale) the results of the ResNet paper:  

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition, Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun, CVPR 2016.  
### More information
You can find more detailed information in the [lab1 directory](./lab1/README.md).

## Lab 3 Working with Transformers
In this laboratory exercise we will learn how to work with the HuggingFace ecosystem to adapt models to new tasks.  
### More information
You can find more detailed information in the [lab3 directory](./lab3/README.md).

## Lab4 - Adversarial Learning
In this laboratory session I will develop a methodology for detecting OOD samples and measuring the quality of OOD detection. I will also experiment with incorporating adversarial examples during training to render models more robust to adversarial attacks.
### More information
You can find more detailed information in the [lab4 directory](./lab4/README.md).

## Paper video presentation
Here you will find the video presentation of the paper:  
Black-Box On-Policy Distillation of Large Language Models,  
Tianzhu Ye, Li Dong, Zewen Chi, Xun Wu, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei
